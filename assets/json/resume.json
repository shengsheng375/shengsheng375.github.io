Facilitated an automated preprocessing pipeline that uses lung detection to crop and resample CTA volumes, standardizing inputs for the segmentation model."

Drove molecular misidentification down to ≤1.7% (0.5% with score cut-off); a 3 to 1l times improvement over conventional spectral-filtering. Devised an image segmentation model under Dr. Benjamin Brenner, analyzing outer membrane protein distribution using the TOMM20 marker. Produced a supervised learning model to distinguish between adjacent mitochondrial structures in super-resolution images."

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."

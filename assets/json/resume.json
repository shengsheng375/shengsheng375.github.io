Facilitated an automated preprocessing pipeline that uses lung detection to crop and resample CTA volumes, standardizing inputs for the segmentation model."

Drove molecular misidentification down to ≤1.7% (0.5% with score cut-off); a 3 to 1l times improvement over conventional spectral-filtering. Devised an image segmentation model under Dr. Benjamin Brenner, analyzing outer membrane protein distribution using the TOMM20 marker. Produced a supervised learning model to distinguish between adjacent mitochondrial structures in super-resolution images."

We imaged the entire aqueous humor outflow pathway, whose imaging has the potential to customize glaucoma surgeries but is typically constrained by the FOV, circumferentially in mice as a test"

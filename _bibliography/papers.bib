	abstract = {Imaging complex, non-planar anatomies with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is limited by the optical field of view (FOV) in a single volumetric acquisition. Combining linear mechanical translation with OCT extends the FOV but suffers from inflexibility in imaging non-planar anatomies. We report the freeform robotic OCT to fill this gap. To address challenges in volumetric reconstruction associated with the robotic movement accuracy being two orders of magnitudes worse than OCT imaging resolution, we developed a volumetric registration algorithm based on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to overcome this limitation. We imaged the entire aqueous humor outflow pathway, whose imaging has the potential to customize glaucoma surgeries but is typically constrained by the FOV, circumferentially in mice as a test. We acquired volumetric OCT data at different robotic poses and reconstructed the entire anterior segment of the eye. The reconstructed volumes showed heterogeneous Schlemm{\textquoteright}s canal (SC) morphology in the reconstructed anterior segment and revealed a segmental nature in the circumferential distribution of collector channels (CC) with spatial features as small as a few micrometers.Competing Interest StatementHao F.
